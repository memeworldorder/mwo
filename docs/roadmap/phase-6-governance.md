### 🧠 Ecosystem & Governance Strategy

#### 🗳️ DAO-Like Proposals & Governance Modules

**Goal:** Foster a **community-driven protocol** without giving up execution speed.

While not deploying a full DAO immediately, MWOR will operate under **DAO-like proposal systems** for key ecosystem decisions:

### 🛠️ Governance Proposal System

**Powered via:** Snapshot-like off-chain voting + on-chain multi-sig confirmation\
**Voting Weight:** Based on **NFT tier holdings** and **token stake**

**🧩 Governance Proposal Examples:**

| Proposal Type                   | Description                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔥 **Next Burn Event Vote**     | Community chooses burn % allocation from next NFT sale or contest |
| 🎨 **NFT Expansion**            | Decide theme or art direction of the next NFT drop                |
| 🌉 **Cross-Chain Activation**   | Choose which chain to target next with a bridged MWOR drop        |
| 💰 **Prize Allocation Changes** | Rebalance how contest funds are split between tiers               |
| 📦 **Feature Prioritization**   | Pick next SDK feature or burn mechanism to build                  |
|                                 |                                                                   |

3. Voting takes place over 72 hours via wallet sign-in
4. Results posted on-site + announced in Discord
5. Core contributors **commit to outcome**, execute on-chain\
