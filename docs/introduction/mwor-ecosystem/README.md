# 🌍 MWOR Ecosystem

## 🔥 Deflationary Design&#x20;

To preserve long-term value and drive lasting ecosystem momentum, MWOR is engineered around a **deflationary feedback loop**. This ensures every revenue-generating activity—NFT sales, fee capture, or jackpot overflow—feeds back into reducing supply or expanding utility.

This isn't just scarcity for scarcity's sake. It's **a circular economy** where activity fuels value, and value drives demand.

***

### 🔁 Core Feedback Loop

**Revenue Earned → Converted to MWOR → Burned / Recycled / Reinvested**

This loop captures value from:

* Trading activity (fees earned from the CLMM pool)
* NFT mint & royalty revenue
* Jackpot overflow or expired/unclaimed SOL

All revenue is passed through a structured reinvestment system—splitting resources into burn, liquidity growth, and prize/game reserves.

### 🧩 Deflationary Feedback Pillars

&#x20;**Buyback & Burn**

* **Sources:**
  * 30% of protocol profits (fees, NFT sales, etc.)
  * A portion of every NFT mint and secondary royalty
  * Jackpot overflow or expired claims
* **Mechanism:**\
  MWOR is bought directly from the open market—favoring CLMM—and permanently **burned**. This reduces circulating supply, boosts token value per holder, and builds long-term trust.
* **Milestone Triggers:**\
  Additional manual burns are scheduled around major achievements—e.g., `5,000 holders`, `$1M market cap`, or successful product launches.

#### **NFT Driven Deflation**

* A fixed percentage of all **NFT mint revenue** is used to buy MWOR → burn.
* Secondary sale royalties follow the same logic: a portion is auto-burned.
* Higher-tier NFTs burn more, tying **rarity to permanent token reduction**.

This builds a powerful deflation mechanic into every step of the NFT lifecycle.

{% step %}
#### **Vault, Jackpots & Game Mechanics**

* **20% of all profits** are routed to:
  * Jackpot prize pools
  * Seasonal campaigns or raffles
  * Game-driven incentives for participation and loyalty

This ensures MWOR remains central to all game mechanics—rewarding holders without inflating supply.
