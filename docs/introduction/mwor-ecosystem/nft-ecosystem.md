# 🌎 NFT Ecosystem

### Utility & Deflationary Role of MWOR NFTs

Unlike static meme coins that rely solely on hype, MWOR introduces an **exclusive tier-based NFT ecosystem** designed for **utility, scarcity, and sustainable value creation**. Each NFT serves as both a key to the MWOR game economy and a driver of long-term deflation.

### 🧬 Tier-Based NFT System

MWOR’s NFTs are released across **five fixed tiers**, ranging from **Tier 1 (Basic)** to **Tier 5 (Exclusive Legendary)**.

Each tier unlocks:

* **Varying access to competitions and jackpot boosts**
* **Enhanced MWOR token multipliers**
* **Governance privileges**
* **Rarity-based visual traits and metadata**

***
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 🏆 Exclusive Competitions & Bonus Rewards

**NFT holders are automatically enrolled** in special competitions with boosted prize pools based on their tier.

* **Bonus MWOR rewards** are periodically distributed to active holders.
* **Tier multipliers** improve payouts for all jackpots and competitions
* **Higher tiers** grant access to exclusive competitions

### 🔥 NFT-Powered Deflation

Each NFT sale directly contributes to reducing MWOR’s supply:

* A **fixed % of every mint and royalty** is used to **buy MWOR from the open market** and **permanently burn it**.
* These burns are:
  * **Publicly verifiable** via Solana transaction hashes
  * **Announced on-chain** and reflected on the MWOR burn dashboard\

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 📉 Supply-Constrained Scarcity Model

To maximize long-term value, **supply is intentionally capped** through multiple mechanisms:

**🔒 Limited Minting Per Holder**

* Each NFT drop targets **\~10% of total MWOR holders**\
  &#xNAN;_&#x65;.g., If 1,500 token holders → only 150 NFTs available_
* This preserves exclusivity and demand across each release.

**🧱 Fixed-Tier Allocation**

* **Higher tiers = lower supply**\
  &#xNAN;_&#x54;ier 5 might only see 5–10 NFTs per drop_
* Lower tiers remain limited, but provide an accessible entry point for more holders.

**💥 Unsold NFT Burn Mechanism**

* If NFTs remain unsold beyond a launch phase or dip below floor price:
  * A percentage are **automatically burned** to maintain scarcity
  * These events are transparently recorded and announced
