### 🧨 **Deflationary Mechanisms**

* 🔁 **Buyback & Burn Strategy**
  * A % of **NFT sales**, **trading fees**, and **jackpot overflow** is used to buy MWOR from the market and **burn it permanently**
  * Burns are **announced publicly** with on-chain tx hashes
* 🔒 **Burns from NFT mechanics**
  * Unsold NFTs below floor → **auto-burned**
  * Higher-tier NFTs trigger **larger burn percentage**\

### 🧠 **Treasury & Allocation Strategy**

* 📈 **Marketing Budget** — Funds viral campaigns, influencer partnerships, and contests
* 🏛️ **CEX Listing Reserve** — Targeted for milestone-based centralized exchange listings
* 💧 **Liquidity Management** — Used to deepen CLMM and stabilize pricing
* 🎁 **Prize Vaults** — Sustain GameFi, competitions, and leaderboard payout\

### 📝 Summary
