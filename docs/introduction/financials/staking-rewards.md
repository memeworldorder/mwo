### Staking for Sustainable Growth

**MWOR** offers **up to 48% APY** for holders who stake their tokens for six months or longerâ€”an approach that both rewards dedicated participants and helps stabilize the ecosystem.&#x20;

### How the Staking Program Works

1. **Locked Rewards (40M Tokens):**\
   A dedicated reward pool continuously distributes MWOR to stakers based on lock duration and APY tier. Locking for at least 6 months earns up to 48% APY.\

2. **Community Engagement (180M Staked):**\
   Community members have already locked 180 million tokens, reflecting deep confidence in MWORâ€™s roadmap and a desire to mitigate short-term market swings.\

3. **Mitigating Volatility & Encouraging Growth:**
   * **Reduced Circulating Supply:** Long-term locks help prevent sudden sell-offs and temper speculative hype cycles.
   * **Organic Appreciation:** By staking for six months or more, holders benefit from price appreciation without requiring treasury buybacks or forced burns.
   * **Rewarding Loyalty:** Higher APY tiers incentivize a genuine commitment to MWORâ€™s future.\

### Streamflow Partnership

To ensure a secure, streamlined staking experience, MWOR has partnered with **Streamflow**:

* **Audited & Trusted:** \
  All Streamflow smart contracts have been audited by reputable third parties.
* **Efficient & Scalable:** \
  Outsourcing the lock-and-release functionality removes overhead from the MWOR dev team, freeing resources for other ecosystem innovations.\\

### Transparency & Audits

* **On-Chain Tracking:** \
  Every rewards distribution can be verified on the Solana Explorerâ€”providing clear, immutable records for the community.
* **Regular Reporting:** \
  MWOR publishes monthly updates detailing staked amounts, reward emissions, and upcoming vesting schedules, linking directly to transaction hashes for proof.\


#### With significant tokens staked and a sizable rewards pool, MWORâ€™s staking program aligns strong **community conviction** with tangible benefitsâ€”supporting the tokenâ€™s long-term stability and growth potential.
